# Proposal-Work-Plan-Tool
This script is attached to a Google Sheet and allows one to generate Latex tables that may be included in a Latex document written for a research grant proposal using the "\input" command.  The tables describe the proposal's work-plan and associated schedules and labor distribution among the proposing team, and are rendered in 2 different versions:  an anonymous and non-anonymous version for inclusion in dual-anonymous-reviewed grant programs.  The tool allows one to make tweaks, additions, deletions and quickly re-render the new versions of these tables without worrying about human error or inconsistencies that arise when such edits are performed manually.
