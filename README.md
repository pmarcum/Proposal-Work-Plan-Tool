# Proposal-Work-Plan-Tool
This script is attached to a Google Sheet and allows one to generate Latex tables that may be included in a Latex document written for a research grant proposal using the "\input" command.  The tables describe the proposal's work-plan and associated schedules and labor distribution among the proposing team, and are rendered in 2 different versions:  an anonymous and non-anonymous version for inclusion in dual-anonymous-reviewed grant programs.  The tool allows one to make tweaks, additions, deletions and quickly re-render the new versions of these tables without worrying about human error or inconsistencies that arise when such edits are performed manually.

The below is a link to the Proposal Work Plan Tool spreadsheet on Google Drive:

If you hit the "Copy" button that appears when you follow the above link, a copy of the spreadsheet will appear on the "Shared With Me" folder in your Google Drive. That copy, which will include the attached script that makes Proposal Work Plan Tool work, is yours to use as you write your own grant proposals. Note that you should move the spreadsheet down into a designated folder, which is where the latex files that are generated by the script will also be placed.

The script should be ready to start accepting input, right out of the box. You may have to "accept permissions" when you try running "LIBRARY FUNCTIONS -> UPDATE LIBRARY" the first time.

Feel free to contact me if you run into permission problems or if you notice any bugs as you use the code.

A video that describes Proposal Work Plan Tool and walks through all of its functions, including how to link the generated Latex table files on Google Drive with your Overleaf project, is provided at this YouTube link:
